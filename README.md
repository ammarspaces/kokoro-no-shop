Demo: https://kokoro-mask-shop.netlify.app

This is my attempt on creating pure HTML and CSS website so no profit made from this project

All the mask images are public domain

All Hata No Kokoro images taken from https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Hata_no_Kokoro Specifically:

1. Background - from Who's Who of Humans and Youkai - Everlasting Edition illustrated by Genji Asai
2. Image in About Me - from Forbidden Scrollery manga
